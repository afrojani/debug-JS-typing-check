                        <div class="accordion-body"> The main difference is that localStorage has a different expiration
                            time, sessionStorage will only be accessible while and by the window that created it is
                            open. localStorage lasts until the user deletes it. Lets say that a user wanted to save a
                            login username and password he would want to use sessionStorageover localStorage for
                            security reasons (ie. another person accessing their account at a later time). But if he
                            wanted to save a user's settings on their machine you would probably want localStorage. All
                            in all: localStorage - use for long term use. sessionStorage - use when you need to store
                            somthing that changes or somthing temporary. </div>

                            with fast UI development. Bootstrap comes with a set of pre-styled responsive, mobile-first
                            components that possess a definite UI kit. Tailwind CSS uses a set of utility classes to
                            create a neat UI with more flexibility and uniqueness. Sites created using Bootstrap follow
                            the generic pattern that makes them look identical. </div>

                        <div class="accordion-body"> In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements
                            are modeled in browser engines and how the dimensions of those HTML elements are derived
                            from CSS properties. It is a fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages.CSS
                            determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of
                            these boxes. Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective
                            edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge. </div>

                            HTML page rather than just presentation. It makes HTML more comprehensible by better
                            defining the different sections and layout of web pages. The core characteristic of a
                            semantic element is that it clearly communicated its meaning to both the developer and the
                            browser. Header, Nav, Section, Article, Aside, Footer; these are examples of semantic tags.
