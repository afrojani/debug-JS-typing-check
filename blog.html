                        <div class="accordion-body"> The main difference is that localStorage has a different expiration
                            time, sessionStorage will only be accessible while and by the window that created it is
                            open. localStorage lasts until the user deletes it. Lets say that a user wanted to save a
                            login username and password he would want to use sessionStorageover localStorage for
                            security reasons (ie. another person accessing their account at a later time). But if he
                            wanted to save a user's settings on their machine you would probably want localStorage. <br>
                            All in all: localStorage - use for long term use. sessionStorage - use when you need to
                            store somthing that changes or somthing temporary. </div>

                            contains, and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope
                            is generally the web page inside which all the code is being executed. So, in javascript the
                            whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are contained in
                            this global scope. <br> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or
                            inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be
                            consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.

                        <div class="accordion-body"> The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and
                            the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event
                            from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an
                            iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. <br> Event loop is an endless loop, which
                            waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event loop
                            executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no
                            ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises. </div>

                        <div class="accordion-body"> The undefined is a primitive type in JavaScript. So the undefined
                            is a type. And the undefined type has exactly one value that is undefined. JavaScript uses
                            the undefined value in the following situations. 1) Accessing an uninitialized variable. 2)
                            Accessing a non-existing property of an object. 3) Function parameters: When you call a
                            function with a number of parameters, you often pass the same number of arguments. If you
                            donot pass argument for any parameter and call the function, then it will return undefined
                            for that parameter. 4) A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns
                            undefined. 5) Accessing out-of-bounds array elements When you access an array element that
                            is out-of-bounds, you’ll get the undefined value. </div>
